In this program we got a grid which user can provide it\textquotesingle{}s size in textfields, the probability of the cell\textquotesingle{}s color change and the speed of changes.~\newline
 Every cell in the grid is a {\bfseries{Thread}} in which every certain period of time (the delay is equal to a randomly selected ~\newline
 number of milliseconds from the interval \mbox{[}0.\+5k, 1.\+5k\mbox{]}) performs the following actions\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item with probability p it changes its color to a random color;
\item with probability 1 -\/ p checks the colors of its four neighbors (we treat the board as a two-\/dimensional track. we treat as a two-\/dimensional torus) and takes the average of them as its color.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each cell can be suspended and resumed by clicking on it\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Overview}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
